##Arctic Station Roadmap

Early Development:

- Buildable beacons (code has not been remade yet.)
- Fix snow construction (works, but defaults to snow tile for new floor tiles on snow.)
- Glacier Expedition (WIP, part of mapping)
- Replace spacesuits with snowsuits, hoods, masks, etc.
- Remove pressure altogether, it shouldnt appear when you leave the base.
- Fix oxygen on snow (Possibly fixed, either oxygen or the temperature is causing mobs to be pushed INTO the base.)
- Change flamethrower into a flamethrower with the appearance of the one from The Thing.
- Map the main station and russian station. (Russian station is a seperate Z-Level.)

Mid Development

- Corgis into Wolves/Huskies/Alaskan Malamutes. (More The Thing references.)
- Crashed UFO in the Glacier (Dead huggers, maybe some form of spawning a changeling on entry?)
- Change most tech sprites into old 80s 90s style tech, and higher tech items into tech akin to the original Alien.

Late Development

- Singularity engine > Diesel engine
- Give the changeling a dog form
- Playable russian station?
- New changeling detection systems? (Lights are kinda weird in my opinion, maybe a blood test like The Thing.)

More?
